        <h2>Programming Language</h2>
        <p>
          If you want your game to actually work, you’ll need to put some time into programming. This is often one of
          the most technical aspects of game development, so it’s important to have at least a basic understanding of
          common programming languages like C++ , Unreal Blueprints ,C# or UnityScript.

        <p>
          After you have a solid concept, it’s time to start designing the game. This includes everything from

        <h2>Art and Asset Creation</h2>

        <p>
          In order for your game to look and feel its best, you’ll need to create high-quality art assets. This includes
          everything from 2D sprites and 3D models to user interface elements and background scenery.

        <h2>Testing  </h2>

        <p>
          Once you have a playable build of your game, it’s time to start testing. This includes playtesting your game internally to iron out any bugs or glitches, as well as conducting external beta tests with larger groups of players.

        <h2>Ideas and Creativity</h2>

        <p>This is where it all begins – coming up with the initial idea for your game. Once you have an idea,
          it’s important to start fleshing it out by asking yourself key questions such as “What kind of
          gameplay experience do I want to create?”, “What kind of story do I want to tell?”, “Who is my
          target audience?” etc.</p>
